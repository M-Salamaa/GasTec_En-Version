In addition to carrying out feasibility studies and assessments required for pilot project&rsquo;s economics and competitive products in preperaaation for establishing a partnership between the parties in the future as to expand in covering the local needs of CNG fueling stations in different governorates. </p><p class="Normal ">The second MOU aims at assembling and producing CNG conversion kit for vehicles run by bi-fuel system (CNG &ndash; gasoline) and mixed fuel (CNG &ndash; diesel), transferring the know-how in order to boost the manufacturing experiences. In addition to training and developing local team of experts who works with local vehicles fleets, manufactured companies and other companies working in developing the technique of adopting CNG in G-mobility.</p><p class="Normal ">In addition, the cooperation with Landi Renzo targets developing the infrastructure and equipment in Egypt, the new production lines such as; tools, machines, testing units needed to assemble and manufacture CNG conversion kits components for example; Traditional and Synchronous Gas Regulators, Timing Advance processor, Gas Electricity wiring and High Pressure Pipes and&nbsp; supporting the establishment of Egyptian Industries through localizing the purchase of parties used in assembling the conversion kit components as well as other components. </p><p class="Normal ">Landi Renzo is considered one of Italian and international companies owning big experience in designing and producing parties, components and systems of vehicles conversion run by gasoline and diesel to run by CNG. In addition, the activities of gas pressure related to CNG-run vehicles. As well, its accumulated experience as a result of its partnership with SAFE&amp;CEC SRL Company in designing, engineering and manufacturing gas compressors and its applications.</p><p class="Normal ">It is scheduled that such pilot projects of the two MOUs would effectively contributed to developing the expansion projects in adopting CNG as an alternative fuel in F-mobility in Egypt. Also, localizing such vital industries in Egypt as a beginning to export it abroad and supporting the introduction of OEM vehicles in the Egyptian market in cooperation with manufacturers existing in Egypt as well as companies importing vehicles.</p></body></html>
