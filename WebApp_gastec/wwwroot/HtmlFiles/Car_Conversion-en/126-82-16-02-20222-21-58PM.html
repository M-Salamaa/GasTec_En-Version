Regarding diesel-run vehicles, the Modern Conversion Technology in the world contributed to providing developed conversion kits in which the vehicle could be run at a different mixing percentage for CNG and diesel.</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">2- Is gasoline fuel canceled if the vehicle is converted to run by CNG?</span></p><p class="Normal "> No, only the conversion kit components are added without any amendment in engine with the possibility of operating vehicle by CNG or gasoline.</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">3- Does CNG affect old vehicle as result of conversion?</span></p><p class="Normal ">CNG has no effect on old vehicles, as converting kits are available for all types of vehicles to run by CNG, but inspection is required before the conversion process whereas vehicles with technical competence less than 70% are not converted.</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">4- Does CNG affect the engine torque while driving?</span></p><p class="Normal ">Regarding to engine torque, it is a result of incorporating CNG inside the combustion chamber in a gas form, the required amount of CNG becomes relatively less than the required amount in liquid fuel, which affects the ability to accelerate by not more than 6% in the maximum operating conditions, but this helps to saving from CNG consumption than gasoline with the same proportion. In order to overcome this, a device provides a spark with CNG is installed to obtain a complete combustion, leading to increasing the capacity when using CNG.</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">5- Does the use of CNG corrode the engine components?</span></p><p class="Normal ">Due to the nature of dry gas fuel and the lack of oiling property, some effect appeared on the fuel valves in vehicles&rsquo; engine manufactured before 1990, until the end of the last century in which gasoline containing lead element was used who was creating a layer on the entry valves reducing friction and temperature to protect it against corrosion.</p><p class="Normal ">But with the development in manufacturing new engines designed to run by unleaded gasoline and with the use of appropriate synthetic lubricants, the use of CNG in vehicles no longer represent a problem. As well, the increase in number of octane of CNG to (120) has led to the disappearance of slapping phenomenon that appears with the use of gasoline and directly affects the engine lifespan, therefore the use of CNG preserves the internal parts of the engine compared to 92 and 95 gasoline octane.</p><p class="Normal "> </p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">6- What is the relation between CNG meter and gasoline liter?</span></p><p class="Normal ">The consumption of CNG meter is equivalent to gasoline liter.</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">7- How far is the cylinder durability in case of vehicle direct collisions?</span></p><p class="Normal ">CNG cylinder is made of steel and does not have any welds and designed to endure high pressures and violent collisions. The cylinder passes rigorous tests during its manufacturing phase to ensure the highest levels of safety and security when operating.</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">8- Does the vehicle need a modification in the rear parts due to a fixed load of the cylinder?</span></p><p class="Normal ">There are many cylinder sizes that are suitable for all vehicles and do not need any modification, but some vehicles manufactured in a way that the rear of the vehicle is approaching from the ground, need to make some minor adjustments to maintain the same height.</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">9- Is it preferable that the vehicle is designed with CNG instead of being modified and converted to run by CNG?</span></p><p class="Normal ">The largest percentage of vehicles run by CNG in the world are converted in which there is no modification in its engine, only adding the conversion kit to operate with a high efficiency. However, vehicles designed to run by CNG are characterized by installing CNG cylinders in a cavity below the vehicle chassis making the best use of the rear luggage box of the vehicle</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">10- Can CNG be used in other transportation than vehicles?</span></p><p class="Normal ">Due to the high operating economics of CNG, its uses has expanded worldwide during the previous years in several sectors such as railways, boats and river ferries, light aircraft and various ground services units in airports.</p></body></html>
