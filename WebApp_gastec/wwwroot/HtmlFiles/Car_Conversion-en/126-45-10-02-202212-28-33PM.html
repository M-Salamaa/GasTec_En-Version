CNG quantities are controlled electronically through a special program on a laptop characterized by saving fuel consumption and performance equals to gasoline. Gasoline converted automatically to CNG after reaching the appropriate temperature by the engine also reaching number of windings adjusted by the special program.

As a result, the Company ranks the highest market share in such field using the latest conversion systems fitting the modern vehicles. It is worth noting that such advanced system guarantees achieving the best performance for such type of vehicles, as its efficiency equals to gasoline octane 95 as well as attaining more savings.</p><p class="Normal "> </p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">Advantages of Direct Injection conversion system</span></p><p class="Normal ">1- Less fuel consumption.</p><p class="Normal ">2- Same performance as gasoline 95.</p><p class="Normal ">3- Adjusting the engines using the laptop.</p><p class="Normal ">4- A self-selection for the type of fuel.</p><p class="Normal ">5- Such system is considered the latest type of conversion system.</p><p class="Normal "><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p class="Normal "><span class="s_6C8EFA9D">The improvement of vehicle performance after the conversion to CNG</span></p><p class="Normal ">-Decreasing the cost of fuel consumption for more than the double compared to gasoline 92.</p><p class="Normal "> - Increasing the efficiency of the vehicle's engine by 10%, as the fuel is completely burned inside the engine as CNG is a clean fuel and its octane number is higher than gasoline (about 120 octane).</p><p class="Normal "> - Maintaining the efficiency of lubricating oils, thus changing them over longer periods, in addition to maintaining buggy, appletinis, condenser and the vehicle maintenance for a longer time period.</p><p class="Normal "> -Reducing the ratio of noise and vibration.</p><p class="Normal ">-Absence of polluted and harmful components due to vehicles&rsquo; exhaust.</p><p dir="RTL" class="Normal p_C835B624"><span>&nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
